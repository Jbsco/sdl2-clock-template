# sdl2-clock-template
This is a C++ SDL2 template program that I wrote and used in Fall 2022. It is a simple clock that includes very simple SDL2 patterns for rendering and animating images.

Hilariously, I chose to make the second hand rotate in the counter-clockwise direction. For half of the second, the hand is animated rotating counter-clockwise to the next position, 6-degrees clockwise from the starting position. For the other half-second, the hand is paused.
